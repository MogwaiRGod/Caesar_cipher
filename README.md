Caesar cipher
===
<i>The shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. </i>
